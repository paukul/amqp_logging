=AMQPLogging


A ruby logger class that logs to an {AMQP}[http://www.amqp.org/] exchange in addition to your default log device.

==Basic Configuration
By default the logs are routed to the host, exchange and key specified in DEFAULT_OPTIONS.
You can change the configuration when creating the logger object by specifying an argument hash:

   require 'amqp_logging'

   logging_config = { :routing_key => "applogging",
                      :host => AppConfig.amqp_logging.host,
                      :exchange => AppConfig.amqp_logging.exchange }

   logger = AMQPLogging::Logger.new(config.log_path, logging_config)
   config.logger = logger
   
With Rails 3 you will need to modify this a bit, as config.log_path no longer has the desired effect:

   config.logger = AMQPLogging::Logger.new(config.paths.log.to_a.first, logging_config)

==Routing Keys

You can set the routing key with a string or use a generator that respondes to call,
receives the logline as the first argument and returns the routing key.

Example:

   # You can use a lambda or whatever responds to #call as the routing key generator
   AMQPRoutingKeyGenerator = lambda do |logline|
     if logline =~ /(?:engine\[([^\]]*)\])\: (Completed in|Processing|Session ID)?/
       key = "logs.app.#{$1}"
       key << ".statistics" unless $2.nil?
     else
       key = "logs.app.system"
     end
     key
   end

   AMQPLogging::Logger.new($stdout, :routing_key => AMQPRoutingKeyGenerator)
